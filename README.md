## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

The inspection of tea plant diseases and pests is hindered by factors such as manual searching, difficulty in observing inner layer infestations, challenges in detecting early symptoms, and excessive pesticide application. These factors significantly impact tea yield, tea plant health, and the tea industry economy.

### How our technology solution can help

Early Detection of Tea Plant Pathogens and Pests Using AI for Ensuring Tea Plant Health

### Our idea
![Design Concept](https://s12.aconvert.com/convert/p3r68-cdx67/og59qe2xpc/Call%20for%20Code_TEAS-02.png) 
-TEAS is a simple and long handheld detector with a telescopic front lens that probes into the center of the tea tree and among the branches and     leaves. The long-pressure camera uses hard-tube endoscopic lens technology to record the internal conditions of the tea tree, and with Watson       Discovery AI backend recognition, the internal pest and disease conditions of the tea tree captured by the tea farmer are reported to the tea       farmer, using voice and light guidance to enable the tea farmer to detect the problems at an early stage, accurate identification and timely        treatment can also achieve environmental protection.

## Technology implementation

### IBM AI service(s) used

- [WatsonDiscovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-discovery) -By integrating technologies such as dynamic capturing, probing, imaging, and Watson Discovery AI recognition systems, these features are incorporated into TEAS. Coupled with an application (APP), tea farmers can utilize the app to schedule and access information collected by TEAS.![Structure](https://img.onl/SnAccc)

### Solution architecture

The use of TEAS involves capturing, transmitting information, AI recognition, and data feedback process flowchart.

It encompasses three major components: the operation of the mobile app system, cloud-based data comparison, and information transmission from TEAS handheld device.
